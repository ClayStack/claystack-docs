# Introduction

### What is ClayStack?

ClayStack is a modular DVT-based liquid restaking protocol that offers a highly secure, decentralized, and scalable liquid restaking solution. Users can effortlessly mint csETH by depositing ETH, earning rewards while enjoying the flexibility of native restaking on EigenLayer without deposit caps.

With features like instant ETH withdrawal, transparent CLAY point redemption, and a dynamic points system, ClayStack transforms staking into a secure, flexible, and rewarding experience.

Through leveraging Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) and introducing the Validator Funding Provider (VFP) initiative, ClayStack focuses on eliminating minimum capital requirements for Ethereum validator nodes, ensuring scalability, and prioritizing industry-leading safety.\
