# IcsETH
IcsETH is a standard ERC20 token that represents the claim to both the underlying token and the staking rewards for deposits in KYC'd or DVT pools. IcsETH is a highly secure offering by ClayStack that is aimed to cater to complex institutional and enterprise demands. 

To mint IcsETH, users need to deposit a minimum amount of ETH to the protocol and undergo several compliance checks before they are whitelisted. Only whitelisted users can mint IcsETH.In order to qualify for the whitelist, ClayStack defines KYC'd procedural checks for users to get onboarded. These steps will include KYC/AML checks, sanctions checks, and more. 

IcsETH is created with a great emphasis on regulatory compliance. While they are not 1:1 tradeable with csETH, users can mint IcsETH from their csETH by opening overcollateralized positions and/or undergoing the same compliance checks. Similar to csETH, users do not need to restake their csETH to generate rewards. 

ClayStack will also partner with custodians to offer superior management and security of IcsETH for whitelisted users.
