# IGD
Our Initial Governance Diversification (IGD) mechanism has been designed to collectively target ETH users by incentivizing them to stake with us. As such, the mechanism highly favours community participation by users across the entire ClayStack protocol (whether that is by staking assets, providing liquidity across pools, bringing in referrals, and many more).
