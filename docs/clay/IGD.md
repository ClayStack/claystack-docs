# Claystack's Initial Governance Diversification (IGD) program
The Initial Governance Diversification (IGD) mechanism is strategically designed to collectively engage Ethereum (ETH) users by providing compelling incentives for staking with us. Users actively participating in IGD have the opportunity to accumulate Clay Points, which will be seamlessly converted to $CLAY tokens at a 1:1 ratio.
Users depositing $ETH in ClayStack's protocol can earn up to 40 clay points for every 1 $ETH deposited.

# IGD Reward Calculation
The weekly reward is determined by various factors, including the following points:

1. IGD distributes clay points for activities like staking and providing liquidity within the ClayStack protocol.More activities will be added soon.
2. Each week establishes a floor and a ceiling for the distribution of clay points across different activities.

# Understanding Reward Rates for ETH Deposits
## Base Rate:
Users earn $CLAY through the Base Rate upon depositing $ETH.
The Base Rate is adjusted to maintain a balance that attracts liquidity and influences the demand for csETH.

## Weekly Stakers Rate:
Increased stakers for the week result in a higher number of $CLAY earned by everyone.
Weekly Deposits Rate:
Higher ETH deposits for the week lead to an increased number of $CLAY earned by everyone.
As the ClayStack protocol gains more users, the demand for csETH rises, subsequently increasing the distribution of $CLAY points. IGD acts like a speedometer, reflecting the level of user activity - it rises with increased deposits and decreases during periods of reduced activity. The exciting part? It refreshes every 7 days!

## Boosted $CLAY Rewards and Vesting
Users enjoy boosted $CLAY rewards during the IGD period.
These boosted rewards start vesting after a 6-month period, ensuring users fully leverage the benefits of ClayStack's Ethereum liquid staking protocol.

## Community-Driven Boosted Rewards
Every time the Weekly Staker counter increases by 1 ETH, users earn an additional 0.1 $CLAY.
Every time the Weekly Deposits counter increases by 100 ETH, users earn an additional 0.01 $CLAY.
These rewards change weekly based on the number of deposits and stakers, offering the potential to consistently earn 40 $CLAY weekly for high deposits across consecutive weeks.
