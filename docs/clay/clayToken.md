# $Clay
$CLAY, ClayStack's native token, is ERC-20 compatible and holds a pivotal role in ensuring the seamless operation of the ClayStack platform. As the native governance token for the ClayStack protocol, $CLAY is indispensable for key governance decisions, validator selection, exit criteria, and more.

The multifaceted utility of $CLAY extends to several critical aspects:

Protocol Growth and Ecosystem Incentivization:
$CLAY plays a central role in fostering the growth of the ClayStack protocol through incentivization schemes and ecosystem development.

Community Management, Education, and Outreach:
Engaging actively with the community, $CLAY contributes to effective community management, education initiatives, and outreach programs.

Despite the impending confirmation of its final design, $CLAY is already set to serve these initial functions. The ultimate aim is to secure the listing of $CLAY tokens upon release, ensuring broader accessibility and liquidity.

With a maximum total supply capped at 100 million, 5% of the total supply is thoughtfully allocated for community rewards, emphasizing the commitment to inclusivity and community-driven growth within the ClayStack ecosystem.

# What are Clay points ?
Clay Points serve as reward points within the ClayStack ecosystem, poised for conversion into $CLAY tokens following the Token Generation Event (TGE). This conversion takes place seamlessly at a 1:1 ratio, ensuring a direct correlation between Clay points and $CLAY tokens.

To accrue Clay Points, users can actively engage in the ClayStack Initial Governance Diversification(IGD) program, maximizing their opportunities to accumulate these valuable points.

Previous users and supporters of the ClayStack protocol will receive special recognition as we introduce a rewarding system. By converting their already accumulated Mission Hub points and diamonds, these early contributors will seamlessly transition their existing benefits into Clay Points. Stay tuned for more detailed information, which will be shared shortly.

# What is Claystack's IGD program ?
ClayStack's Initial Governance Diversification (IGD) program is a pioneering approach to distributing $CLAY tokens to the vibrant and engaged community members of our protocol through a variety of stimulating activities.

Our IGD mechanism is strategically crafted to collectively engage ETH users, providing compelling incentives for them to stake with us. This innovative approach strongly encourages active participation across the entire ClayStack protocol. Whether users are staking assets, contributing liquidity to pools, bringing in referrals, or engaging in various other activities, the IGD program rewards community involvement.
