## 4. How to Run a Solo Staker Node?
Running a solo staker node on csETH allows you to independently validate transactions and contribute to the Ethereum network's security. To run a solo staker node:

Register for the Claystack solo node operator program via xyz.com.
Pay the initial bond amount of 8 ETH to participate as a solo node operator.
Wait for the delegator pool to accumulate ample liquidity.
Once the delegator pool has sufficient liquidity, you can start running your solo staker node and earn rewards for your contribution to the network's security.
Running a solo staker node requires technical expertise and a robust infrastructure setup. It's important to ensure you meet the necessary hardware and software requirements and follow Claystack's guidelines and best practices for running a reliable and secure solo staker node.
