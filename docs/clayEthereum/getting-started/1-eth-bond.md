What is 1 eth bond 

1. Claystack aims to bring complete decentralization to ethereum network by removing high bond entry barrier for running validator . It can be achieved by gradual process of monitoring each claystack registered node performance, rewards etc .
2. All this info will be stored onchain on L2s and claystack's noval algorithm will calculate the bond amount required for each validator on the basis of past performance
3. If performance of node is upto the mark than the algorithm can reduce bond requirement for that validator to upto 1 eth




What is VFP
Validator fund provider , are people who wants to take higher risks than delegator and in return wants higher rewards. The node validator bond will remain 4eth but in order to reach 1eth bond for validators there will be a separate pool in which these users can put there eth that will be used to fulfill validator bond amount if algorithm find that validator competent enough to utilize these funds from pool. thus validator can run more node for same bond amount provided earlier.

Rewards for VFP
VEF shares direct rewards from validator reward shares in return for providing liquidity in this high risk pool

risk 
VEF with rewards also shares the risk associated with validator. If validator does not performs well then penalities applied to validator will be applied to VFP as well.
