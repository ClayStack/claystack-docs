## Mission

csETH is dedicated to the progression of the global staking industry. Our aim is to construct an inclusive, secure, scalable, highly decentralized, and censorship-resistant architecture that boosts staking adoption, making it a mainstream element in the ecosystem.

csETH is determined to offer an unparalleled solution to users by enabling the running of a validator node on Ethereum with a mere 1 ETH bond, while upholding the highest standards of security. Moreover, it aspires to assist staker by maintaining the most stringent standards of decentralization and security for csETH. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of csETH to comprehend how it advances the ETH staking ecosystem, and endows it with the necessary tools to onboard the next billion users.

1. Supports all type and level of staker / delegator. No matter what level of expertise a user has , if user has eth in the wallet , they can use any of the several ways which claystack provides on the basis of there interest. 
2. Higher yields , {QUESTION : do we need to mention farming benefits + clay or not ?}
3. Highly secured and rigorously tested smart contracts
4. Decentralized oracles, mostly protocol uses centralized oracles but at claystack in order to bring complete decentralization we will eventually make our reward / price oracles completely decentralized
5. Other important point for supporting decentralization we will need to lower the barrier to entry , currently barrier to entry is very high due to which only large funds holders can only participate in network solidification. With 1 eth bond strategy we are trying to lower the bond amount so that more people are encouraged to participate in validation thus making ethereum more robust and decentralized.
6. Currently on handful companies hold the major portion of staked eth, which in return creates a bottle neck for decentralization. CS is trying to resolve this issue.
7. Protocol fees (reward , withdrawal, IW fees): Lesser than any protocol
8. Integration and partnership
9.
