# How to Delegate ETH
This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to delegate ETH to Claystack for staking. By following these instructions, users can actively participate in the staking process and benefit from the rewards generated by their delegated ETH.

Please note that the following steps assume you are accessing Claystack's services through their website at claystack.com.

## Step 1: Access Claystack's Website
To begin the delegation process, navigate to claystack.com using your preferred web browser. Ensure that you are on the official Claystack website to maintain the highest level of security.

## Step 2: Select Ethereum Staking Option
Once you have accessed the Claystack website, locate and select the Ethereum staking option. This option indicates that you are choosing to delegate your ETH specifically for staking purposes on the Ethereum network.

## Step 3: Enter Delegation Amount
After selecting the Ethereum staking option, you will be prompted to enter the amount of ETH you wish to delegate. Carefully input the desired amount, ensuring its accuracy before proceeding.

## Step 4: Choose ETH or WETH
At this stage, you have the option to choose whether you want to delegate ETH or Wrapped ETH (WETH). Select the appropriate option based on your preference and the type of asset you possess.

## Step 5: Click the Stake Button
Once you have specified the delegation amount and chosen the asset type, locate the "Stake" button on the Claystack interface. Click this button to initiate the delegation process.

## Step 6: Note on ETH Deposit and csETH Tokens
Upon completing the delegation process, it is important to note that you will receive csETH tokens in return for your ETH deposit. These csETH tokens represent your delegated ETH and will be used to generate staking rewards on your behalf.

By following these steps, you can delegate your ETH to Claystack and begin participating in the staking process. Keep in mind that staking rewards will be generated based on the amount of csETH tokens you hold, and these rewards will be reflective of your contribution to the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network.
