# How to Whitelist an SSV Operator Node on Claystack
To whitelist your SSV (Secret Shared Validator) operator node on Claystack and participate in the SSV validation process, you need to follow the steps outlined below. By completing these steps, you can apply to join the Claystack SSV operator network and contribute to the security and scalability of the Ethereum ecosystem.

Please note that the following steps assume you are accessing the Claystack DVT SSV operator program through the website xyz.com, specifically on the Polygon chain.

## Step 1: Register for the Claystack DVT SSV Operator Program
To get started, you must register for the Claystack DVT SSV operator program. Visit xyz.com and locate the registration page dedicated to SSV operators on the Polygon chain. Provide the required information during the registration process to create your account and express your interest in becoming an SSV operator.

## Step 2: Pay the Initial Bond Amount
As part of the registration process, you will be required to pay an initial bond amount. For SSV operator nodes, the bond amount is set at 1 ETH per node assignment. This bond amount serves as a commitment to your role and responsibilities as an SSV operator. The bond amounts you pay will be deposited on the Polygon chain, reducing gas costs and improving efficiency.

## Step 3: Run the Testnet with Claystack
After successfully registering and paying the bond amount, you will have the opportunity to run the testnet with Claystack. This step allows you to familiarize yourself with the platform's SSV functionalities, gain hands-on experience, and demonstrate your technical competence as an SSV operator. Follow the provided guidelines and instructions to set up and run the testnet environment on the Polygon chain.
