# SSV Integration with Claystack
Claystack has integrated with the Secret Shared Validator (SSV) network to enhance the security and decentralization of its platform. SSV is a network that provides enhanced security for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains by introducing an additional layer of validation through secret sharing.

The integration of SSV with Claystack brings several advantages and benefits to the platform and its users:

## Enhanced Security: 
SSV adds an extra layer of security to the validator nodes in Claystack. By utilizing secret sharing techniques, SSV ensures that no single validator has complete access to the validation process. This mitigates the risks associated with a single point of failure and increases the overall security of the network.

## Protection Against Malicious Behavior: 
SSV helps to protect the network from potential malicious activities by validators. Through the use of secret sharing, SSV prevents any single validator from acting alone in a way that could compromise the network's integrity. This cooperative security mechanism fosters trust and ensures the reliability of the validation process.

## Decentralization: 
By integrating with SSV, Claystack further promotes decentralization within its network. The SSV network is designed to distribute the validation process across multiple independent validators, preventing any single entity from exerting too much control. This aligns with Claystack's commitment to creating a more decentralized and resilient staking ecosystem.

## Improved Validator Selection Process:
 SSV's secret sharing mechanism also improves the validator selection process on Claystack. Validators who participate in the SSV network are evaluated based on their performance and adherence to the SSV protocol. This evaluation process helps Claystack identify and onboard the most reliable and trustworthy validators, contributing to the overall security and integrity of the platform.
