# csETH
csETH is a standard ERC20 token that represents the claim to both the underlying token and the staking rewards for deposits in the Standard Delegator pool. Users can mint csETH by depositing any amount of ETH to the protocol and can be minted by any user (for as low as 0.001 ETH). csETH value appreatiates with time as it accure rewards from delegation to validator nodes.
By simply holding csETH, users keep accruing staking rewards in their wallet without needing to re-stake and/or re-delegate to the protocol. 

The csETH tokens are fully composable and tradable across the wider DeFi ecosystem. ClayStack aims to integrate with other protocols to expand the use-cases for the csTokens, such as using them as collateral on lending protocols.
