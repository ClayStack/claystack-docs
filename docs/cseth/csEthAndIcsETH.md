# csETH and IcsETH
ETH in the Claystack ecosystem comes in two forms, csETH (Claystack Ether), and IcsETH (Institutional Claystack Ether). 

&nbsp;
## csETH
csETH is a standard ERC20 token that represents the claim to both the underlying token and the staking rewards for deposits in the Standard Delegator pool. Users can mint csETH by depositing any amount of ETH to the protocol and can be minted by any user (for as low as 0.001 ETH). csETH value appreatiates with time as it accure rewards from delegation to validator nodes.
By simply holding csETH, users keep accruing staking rewards in their wallet without needing to re-stake and/or re-delegate to the protocol. 

The csETH tokens are fully composable and tradable across the wider DeFi ecosystem. ClayStack aims to integrate with other protocols to expand the use-cases for the csTokens, such as using them as collateral on lending protocols.

## IcsETH
IcsETH is also a standard ERC20 token that represents the claim to both the underlying token and the staking rewards for deposits in KYC'd pools. IcsETH is a highly secure offering by ClayStack that is aimed to cater to complex institutional and enterprise demands. 

To mint IcsETH, users need to deposit a minimum amount of ETH to the protocol and undergo several compliance checks before they are whitelisted. In order to qualify for the whitelist, ClayStack defines KYC'd procedural checks for users to get onboarded. These steps will include KYC/AML checks, sanctions checks, and more. 

IcsETH is created with a great emphasis on regulatory compliance. While they are not 1:1 tradeable with csETH, users can mint IcsETH from their csETH by opening overcollateralized positions and/or undergoing the same compliance checks. Similar to csETH, users do not need to restake their csETH to generate rewards. 

ClayStack will also partner with custodians to offer superior management and security of IcsETH for whitelisted users.
