# FAQs

### What is csETH?
csETH is ClayStack's liquid staking derivative token for Ethereum. It is designed to enhance the security, scalability, and inclusivity of the Ethereum network. It uses innovative technologies to encourage participation in the staking and validation processes.

### Why was ClayStack's Ethereum protocol created?
The ClayStack Ethereum protocol was created to democratize access to staking on the Ethereum network. It lowers the bond requirements for operators, promotes decentralization, and uses a performance-based protocol to determine the bond requirements.

### How is ClayStack's Ethereum liquid staking unique?
ClayStack's Ethereum liquid staking protocol stands out through its use of Decentralized Validation Technology (DVT) and a Validator Funding Provider (VFP) protocol. These technologies enable it to provide a scalable, noncustodial, and highly decentralized protocol that encourages broad participation.

### How does ClayStack support decentralization?
ClayStack is committed to fostering a more decentralized Ethereum network. By reducing entry barriers and encouraging wider participation, it contributes to a distributed landscape where diverse stakeholders actively contribute to network security.

### How decentralized is ClayStack's Ethereum liquid staking?
ClayStack is designed with a strong focus on decentralization. By actively promoting the involvement of a diverse range of validators and delegators, it aims to create a more distributed and resilient network. Its inclusive approach and efforts to reduce barriers to entry encourage wider participation and help to distribute stake concentration, contributing to a more decentralized Ethereum ecosystem.

### What are the advantages of ClayStack's Ethereum liquid staking protocol?
It offers many advantages including lower bond requirements for validators, increased yields for stakers and validators, a performance-based protocol, and a highly decentralized and inclusive staking process.

### What is the Validator Funding Provider (VFP) protocol?
The VFP protocol allows individuals, known as Validator Fund Providers, to contribute ETH to a high-risk pool that is used to fulfill the validator bond requirement. This enables more individuals to become validators and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network.

### What is the role of the Layer 2 Node Operator Management (L2NOM) protocol?
L2NOM is a protocol that allows node operators to manage and interact with csETH on Layer 2 chains. It enables operators to claim rewards, submit proposals for node allocations, monitor their nodes, and maintain their performance reputation in a gas-efficient manner.

### How does ClayStack implement MEV extraction?
ClayStack validators utilize MEV relayers like MEV-Boost to maximize yields. These tools allow validators to manage transaction order within their blocks, leading to additional profits.

### What is Flash Exit in csETH?
Flash Exit is a feature that provides instant liquidity to csETH holders. It allows holders to withdraw their funds without waiting for the unbonding period or avoiding slashing risks, in exchange for a fee.

### How does ClayStack promote inclusivity?
ClayStack is designed to accommodate stakers and delegators of all experience levels. Its user-friendly pathways allow anyone, whether new to staking or an experienced participant, to engage with the platform and start earning rewards.

### What kind of fee structures does ClayStack offer?
ClayStack offers competitive fee structures including reward fees, withdrawal fees, and Flash Exit fees. By minimizing fees, csETH ensures that participants retain a larger share of their rewards, optimizing the value and efficiency of their staked assets.

### How csETH provides better yields?
csETH delivers better yields through active network management, MEV extraction, Flash Exit fees, and reduced insurance costs with VFP. Maximizing staked amounts, capitalizing on transaction order management, providing instant liquidity, and optimizing yields through lower insurance costs and bond requirements.

###What is the risk associated with staking on ClayStack?
Staking with ClayStack involves certain risks such as the possibility of slashing penalties for validators who fail to meet the required performance standards. However, ClayStack employs various mechanisms to mitigate these risks, including insurance through the Validator Funding Provider (VFP) protocol and rigorous security measures.
