# SSV Guide

### How to get started

To start with SSV, follow these steps:

1. Install the SSV client and register as an SSV Operator. Refer to the [Onboarding Guide](https://docs.ssv.network/learn/operators/operator-onboarding) for assistance.
2. Register your node using the same owner account on ClayStack's Node Management dashboard.
3. Ensure your node is active and ready to be added to a cluster for validation.
4. Activate notifications to monitor any alerts from ClayStack.

### SSV Initial Bond Requirement

ClayStack's implementation of SSV includes 4 nodes for each validator. The initial bond requirement to run the first node is 1 ETH. Subsequent nodes will require progressively less based on performance metrics.

### SSV Token Payments & Rewards

ClayStack offers competitive yields for operators through dynamic bond requirements and rewards sharing. Operators who provide quality uptime and active participation will receive good performance scores, which in turn increases their node allocation and returns.

For SSV nodes, the rewards payment includes SSV Tokens and ETH rewards that are compounded and reinvested as csETH, which can be withdrawn at any time. Node Operators are free to set their own fees on the SSV Platform. At the end of an epoch, SSV rewards will account for the amount in SSV tokens paid out and net it out with the csETH payments, ensuring all SSV operators in the same performance bracket receive the same competitive yield.
