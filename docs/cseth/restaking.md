# csETH Re-staking

Claystack's csETH introduces re-staking functionality through EigenLayer's native restaking method. csETH holders can now earn EigenLayer points alongside CLAY points, as ClayStack actively participates in restaking on the EigenLayer protocol. Notably, the use of native restaking by ClayStack's csETH eliminates any maximum deposit cap. This means users can restake any amount of ETH, allowing them to earn restaking points on the entirety of their staked ETH without limitations.

The distribution of these accrued points will be proportional to the csETH holdings of individual users. Users will easily track their EigenLayer rewards alongside CLAY points on Claystack's staking dashboard.

It's important to note that ClayStack utilizes EigenLayer's Native Re-staking for the restaking of  ETH. For a detailed understanding of this restaking process, users can refer to EigenLayer'sÂ [documentation](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/native-restaking), which provides valuable insights into the workings of the EigenLayer protocol.

For csETH holders, the native restaking process is seamlessly encapsulated, ensuring a user-friendly experience. This integration allows users to enjoy both sets of rewards, and the changes in their staking routine are minimal. Notably, csETH holders won't need to take any additional actions to activate restaking. The ClayStack contracts autonomously handle the restaking of ETH, ensuring the continual accrual of staking rewards.

Unlike other LST tokens deposited on EigenLayer, csETH remains unlocked, granting users the flexibility to utilize it in various DeFi protocols while benefiting from dual rewards in CLAY and EigenLayer points.

Existing csETH holders will not be required to take any action to start restaking, and they will begin earning EigenLayer points as soon as Claystack releases the restaking feature. For new users, they just need to deposit ETH and mint csETH to automatically start earning dual rewards.
