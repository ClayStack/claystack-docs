# LST Re-staking 

Claystack now accepts LSTs such as stETH, mETH, etc., to mint csETH and participate in restaking via EigenLayer. Upon depositing LST, csETH is minted to the user based on the current csETH rate, allowing users to hold the liquid staking token and participate in restaking simultaneously.

Claystack will whitelist supported LSTs for deposits. Upon release, Claystack will accept stETH, wbETH, cbETH, mETH, with more LSTs to be added in the coming days.

Note: LST deposits will depend entirely on EigenLayer caps for respective whitelisted LSTs.

Once EigenLayer uncaps the supported LSTs, users can deposit the whitelisted LSTs and mint csETH. Eigen layer token uncapping the respective LSTs is crucial as the deposited amount of LST will be directly restaked to EigenLayer in its entirety. This allows LST holders to earn EigenLayer points along with Clay points while keeping csETH as a liquid staking token, facilitating further DeFi participation.
