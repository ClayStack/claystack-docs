# Native Re-staking

Claystack's csETH introduces re-staking functionality for ETH holders through EigenLayer's native restaking method. ETH holders can now earn EigenLayer points alongside CLAY points, as ClayStack actively participates in restaking on the EigenLayer protocol. Notably, the use of native restaking by ClayStack's csETH eliminates any maximum deposit cap. This means users can restake any amount of ETH, allowing them to earn restaking points on the entirety of their staked ETH without limitations.


It's important to note that ClayStack utilizes EigenLayer's Native Re-staking for the restaking of ETH. For a detailed understanding of this restaking process, users can refer to EigenLayer'sÂ [documentation](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/native-restaking), which provides valuable insights into the workings of the EigenLayer protocol.

For csETH holders, the native restaking process is seamlessly encapsulated, ensuring a user-friendly experience. This integration allows users to enjoy both sets of rewards, and the changes in their staking routine are minimal. Notably, csETH holders won't need to take any additional actions to activate restaking. The ClayStack contracts autonomously handle the restaking of ETH, ensuring the continual accrual of staking rewards.
