# csETH Re-staking Overview 
Claystack's csETH introduces re-staking functionality through EigenLayer. csETH holders now have the opportunity to earn EigenLayer points in addition to CLAY points, as Claystack actively participates in restaking on the EigenLayer protocol. Claystack offers various methods for users to engage in restaking. If a user holds ETH, is already an LST holder, or is already participating in restaking, they can seamlessly mint csETH and start earning EigenLayer points along with Clay points.

### Native Re-staking 
ETH holders can directly deposit ETH to Claystack and mint csETH. The protocol natively restakes all pooled ETH and allows users to restake any amount of ETH, enabling them to earn restaking points on the entirety of their staked ETH without limitations.

### LST Re-staking 
Existing LST holders can participate in Claystack restaking and earn dual rewards by simply restaking their LST on EigenLayer via Claystack and minting csETH. LST deposits are accepted only when the cap for the respective token is updated in EigenLayer. Read more about LST Re-staking [**here**](./lsdRestaking).

### Re-stake Transfer
Existing Re-stakers can also participate in Claystack restaking and earn dual rewards by transferring their restake position on EigenLayer to Claystack. Upon transfer of position, csETH is minted to the user, allowing them to continue participating in restaking while holding liquid token (csETH) simultaneously. There are no caps on re-stake transfers. Read more about LST Re-staking [**here**](./restakeTransfer).
