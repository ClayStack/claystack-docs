# Validator Funding Provider (VFP)

csETH is dedicated to achieving complete decentralization within the Ethereum network by eliminating the high bond entry barrier for running a validator. This objective is realized through a gradual monitoring process that assesses the performance and rewards of each registered Claystack node. To ensure transparency and immutability, all relevant information is stored on-chain using Layer 2 solutions. Leveraging an innovative algorithm, Claystack calculates the bond amount required for each validator based on their historical performance.

The groundbreaking approach implemented by Claystack facilitates a reduction in the bond requirement for validators to as low as 1 ETH. When a validator consistently demonstrates optimal performance, the algorithm recognizes their competence and lowers the bond requirement accordingly. This adjustment aims to foster wider participation in the validation process, enabling more individuals to become validators and contribute to the decentralized nature of the Ethereum network.

In addition to validators, Claystack acknowledges the presence of those individuals seeking higher risks and rewards compared to traditional delegators. These individuals, known as Validator Fund Providers (VFPs), benefit from a separate pool specifically created for their participation. VFPs can contribute their ETH to this pool, which is then utilized to fulfill the validator bond requirement if the algorithm determines that the validator is competent enough to effectively utilize these funds. This groundbreaking mechanism empowers validators to operate multiple nodes with the same bond amount previously required.

VFPs receive incentives through rewards for their active participation. By providing liquidity to the high-risk pool, VFPs acquire VEF (Validator Equity Fund) shares, granting them a portion of the direct rewards generated by validators. This arrangement allows VFPs to earn higher rewards compared to traditional delegators, reflecting the increased risk they undertake.

It is crucial to note that VFPs also share the associated risks with validators. In the event that a validator fails to meet the required performance standards, resulting in penalties being applied to their node, VFPs will also bear the impact of these penalties. This ensures that VFPs have a vested interest in selecting competent validators and actively monitoring the performance of the validators they have invested in.

In summary, Claystack's 1 ETH bond strategy, coupled with the introduction of VFPs and their dedicated pool, exemplifies the platform's commitment to achieving decentralization. By promoting broader participation, incentivizing risk-taking, and aligning rewards and penalties, Claystack establishes an ecosystem where validators and VFPs collaborate to fortify the Ethereum network, while enjoying the associated benefits and jointly assuming the associated risks.
