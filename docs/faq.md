## Staking with ClayStack

### How does staking work?
Within the PoS ecosystem, validators take the role of validating transactions and in return they receive tokens as rewards. ClayStack abstracts the process to allow anyone to stake without having to run validating nodes or without the need for staking expertise. Through a staking smart contract, the user is able to stake token and get back a liquid token that increases in value based on the staking rewards.

### How does unstaking work?
Having your csToken, you can unstake anytime. At the moment of unstaking, your csTokens will be burned and instead your unstake claim will start. You will NOT receive your tokens right away, but will depend on each protocol's unbonding period. Once the period is over, you need to return and claim your tokens, then they will appear in your wallet.

### What is liquid staking?
At the moment of staking, ClayStack gives you a [csToken](#what-is-the-cstoken) in return. This csToken is fully liquid and gives you new possibilities while still enjoying rewards from staking.

### Who holds my assets?
When you stake through ClayStack, the protocol will delegate the token in the chain's stake manager contract, where it will accrue rewards. The stake is spread across different validating nodes, but the validators have no access to the tokens. Those assets are protected by both the chain's Stake Manager contract and ClayStack's contract.

### What is the csToken?

csTokens are a standard ERC20 token that represents the claim to both the underlying Token and the staking rewards, thus csTokens continuously appreciate in value with respect to the base Token.

### What is the value of a csToken?

A csToken is worth more than a simple Token because its value includes all the accrued rewards overtime. Holding a csToken like csMATIC is like holding MATIC, but in addition receives continuous staking rewards.

### How frequently will I get rewards?
Unlike other protocols, rewards are constantly accrued. There is no need to claim rewards to re-stake rewards. ClayStack's protocol does it by design. Your csToken increases in value passively.

### How often does the exchange rate change?
Albeit rewards being accrued constantly, the exchange rate may vary less often. You can expect price changes 2-3 times a day.

### How can I use my csTokens?

Just holding csTokens already is giving you passive income from the staking rewards. You can always sell your csTokens, trade them and soon we will start seeing new use cases emerging like the use of csTokens in lending protocols.

### What is Flash Exit?

Flash Exit is one of ClayStackâ€™s unique features that lets users instantly withdraw their staked tokens. With Flash Exit ther are no unbonding periods.

### What is the difference between Flash Exit and Standard Unstaking?

Flash Exit lets users instantly withdraw their native tokens while in standard unstaking, the user has to wait the "unbonding" period that can range from a few days to a full year depending on the protocol. For Polygon's MATIC, the unbonding ranges from 3-5 days.

### Will I earn rewards during the unbonding period?
No. The moment you unstake, the csToken is burned and your unstake claim starts with the protocol.

### What are the risks of liquid staking?
When you stake, to start you are still exposed to the underlying assets, so relative to stable coins, a csToken still represent a risky investment. Additionally, there are smart contract risks and some protocols carry a slashing risk.

## ClayMatic

### Can I stake my MATIC on Ethereum?
Yes. Polygon's staking protocol is native to Ethereum.

### Can I stake my MATIC on Polygon?
Yes. You can stake your MATIC both on Ethereum network and on Polygon mainnet network.

### What is the APR when I stake MATIC?
For MATIC, the APR varies depending on the total staked MATIC vs the total supply and the number of checkpoints a validator validates. A user can expect an APY of 7-10% after all fees.

### What are the rewards of staking MATIC?
Polygon has allocated 12% of its total supply of 10 billion tokens to fund the staking rewards. These rewards are to be distributed over 5 years across participating validating nodes and delegators.

### Is it safe to stake my MATIC on ClayStack?
Yes. ClayStack's ClayMatic protocol has been audited by ChainSecurity, deemed one of the top firms in the industry. ChainSecurity's audit reports no medium, high, nor critical vulnerabilities which attests to ClayStack's commitment to security. [Audit Report](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/claystack-matic/)

### How long is the unbonding period for MATIC?
Highly depends on network conditions, you can expect a period of 3-5 days. To track Polygon's checkpoints, [continue here](https://wallet.polygon.technology/staking/)

### Why is Flash Exit only available on Polygon?
Flash Exit is a noble feature we wanted to test in a low-gas environment. It will come soon to Ethereum!

### Why is standard Unstaking not available on Polygon?
By design and to increase security, unstaking is done directly from the Polygon's stake manager contract on Ethereum. Enabling this feature in Polygon would require a transaction on Ethereum which would be very expensive in terms of gas. Thus we are offering new alternatives to unstake, Flash Exit and other coming soon!

## ClayStack

### What is ClayStack?

ClayStack is a decentralized liquid staking protocol that offers liquid-staked tokens for PoS chains. These are known as csTokens and can be used across the entire DeFi ecosystem.

### Who is behind ClayStack?
ClayStack was founded by a team with extensive experience on staking, running validating infrastructure and developing smart contracts for the EVM. With this experience and a deep understanding of PoS Blockchains, ClayStack has received the backing from top crypto VC funds, including CoinFund and Parafi, to build the next-gen liquid staking.

### Is ClayStack a DAO? if not, will it eventually turn into a DAO?
No. ClayStack is currently a foundation, yet as part of the plan ClayStack aims to become a DAO.

### What makes ClayStack unique?
Staking is about the details. Up-time, decentralization, node reliability, smart contract security. ClayStack combines a seamless experience with deep staking expertise. With ClayStack all is abstracted away, in a secure and seamless manner. You can get access to the staking rewards without the hassle of the technicalities.
