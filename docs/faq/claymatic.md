### Can I stake my MATIC on Polygon?
Yes. You can stake your MATIC both on Ethereum network and on Polygon mainnet network.

### What is the APY when I stake MATIC?
For MATIC, the APY varies depending on the total staked MATIC vs the total supply and the number of checkpoints a validator validates. A user can expect an APY of 7-9% after fees.

### What are the rewards of staking MATIC?
Polygon has allocated 12% of its total supply of 10 billion tokens to fund the staking rewards. These rewards are to be distributed over 5 years across participating validating nodes and delegators.

### How long is the unbonding period for MATIC?

### Why is Flash Exit only available on Polygon?
Flash Exit is a new feature we wanted to test in a low-gas environment. It will come to Ethereum soon!

### Why is standard unstaking not available on Polygon?
By design and to increase security, unstaking is done directly from the Polygon's stake manager contract on Ethereum. Enabling this feature in Polygon would require a transaction on Ethereum which would be very expensive in terms of gas. Thus we are offering new alternatives to unstake. Flash Exit and others coming soon!
