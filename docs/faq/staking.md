# Staking FAQ

### How does staking work?
Within the PoS ecosystem, validators take the role of validating transactions and in return they receive tokens as rewards. ClayStack abstracts the process to allow anyone to stake without having to run validating nodes or without the need for staking expertise. Through a staking smart contract, the user is able to stake token and get back a liquid token that increases in value based on the staking rewards.

### How does unstaking work?
Having your csToken, you can unstake anytime. At the moment of unstaking, your csTokens will be burned and instead your unstake claim will start. You will NOT receive your tokens right away, but will depend on each protocol's unbonding period. Once the period is over, you need to return and claim your tokens, then they will appear in your wallet.

### What is liquid staking?
At the moment of staking, ClayStack gives you a [csToken](#what-is-the-cstoken) in return. This csToken is fully liquid and gives you new possibilities while still enjoying rewards from staking.

### Who holds my assets?
When you stake through ClayStack, the protocol will delegate the token in the chain's stake manager contract, where it will accrue rewards. The stake is spread across different validating nodes, but the validators have no access to the tokens. Those assets are protected by both the chain's Stake Manager contract and ClayStack's contract.

### What is the csToken?

csTokens are a standard ERC20 token that represents the claim to both the underlying Token and the staking rewards, thus csTokens continuously appreciate in value with respect to the base Token.

### What is the value of a csToken?

A csToken is worth more than a simple Token because its value includes all the accrued rewards overtime. Holding a csToken like csMATIC is like holding MATIC, but in addition receives continuous staking rewards.

### How frequently will I get rewards?
Unlike other protocols, rewards are constantly accrued. There is no need to claim rewards to re-stake rewards. ClayStack's protocol does it by design. Your csToken increases in value passively.

### How often does the exchange rate change?
Albeit rewards being accrued constantly, the exchange rate may vary less often. You can expect price changes 2-3 times a day.

### How can I use my csTokens?

Just holding csTokens already is giving you passive income from the staking rewards. You can always sell your csTokens, trade them and soon we will start seeing new use cases emerging like the use of csTokens in lending protocols.

### What is Flash Exit?

Flash Exit is one of ClayStackâ€™s unique features that lets users instantly withdraw their staked tokens. With Flash Exit ther are no unbonding periods.

### What is the difference between Flash Exit and Standard Unstaking?

Flash Exit lets users instantly withdraw their native tokens while in standard unstaking, the user has to wait the "unbonding" period that can range from a few days to a full year depending on the protocol. For Polygon's MATIC, the unbonding ranges from 3-5 days.

### Will I earn rewards during the unbonding period?
No. The moment you unstake, the csToken is burned and your unstake claim starts with the protocol.

### What are the risks of liquid staking?
When you stake, to start you are still exposed to the underlying assets, so relative to stable coins, a csToken still represent a risky investment. Additionally, there are smart contract risks and some protocols carry a slashing risk.
