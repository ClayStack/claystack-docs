# Node Operators
```
TODO
Describe how nodes work, governance, and how to participate
```
This document is intended for those who wish to participate in the ClayStack protocol as Node Operators — entities
who run Beacon validator nodes on behalf of the protocol and receive fee in return. It consists of
two sections: [General overview](#general-overview) and [Operations HOWTO](#operations-howto).
If you’re here for the technical details of interacting with the protocol, feel free to skip to
the latter.
