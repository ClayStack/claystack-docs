# Introduction

ClayStack is a pioneering liquid staking protocol designed for the Ethereum ecosystem. Our mission is to lead a new era in the global staking industry, with the aim of bringing staking into the mainstream. Our unique approach, anchored in our commitment to decentralization, security, scalability, and inclusivity, sets us apart. [csETH](/cseth/overview), a key part of our platform, enhances the security of Ethereum and DeFi by fostering active participation and promoting scalable, robust staking.

Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as [DVT](/cseth/dvt) (Decentralized Validation Technology) - which promotes decentralized decision-making - and hybrid architectures that balance the benefits of different systems, ClayStack ensures an efficient and secure staking process. This encourages widespread participation and paves the way for a platform that's scalable, non-custodial, and highly decentralized.

ClayStack is designed to be inclusive, inviting both individual home stakers and institutions to participate in the validation process. Our approach, coupled with enhanced reliability and lower bond requirements, democratizes access to staking. We employ algorithmic network balancing through [VFP](/cseth/vfp) to create a decentralized, censorship-resistant, and fault-tolerant network. This means our staking process dynamically balances the roles of professional, non-professional, and top-performing validators, ensuring a robust and resilient network.

We're committed to playing a pivotal role in Ethereum's evolution, enhancing the ecosystem's security, facilitating wider participation, and providing scalable, attractive yields. Our focus on decentralization, inclusivity, and community governance puts us at the cutting edge of the staking industry, contributing to the broader success of the Ethereum ecosystem.
