# Introduction

The ClayStack is a decentralized liquid staking protocol that unlocks the liquidity of staked assets in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks. When users deposit their stakable tokens in ClayStackâ€™s smart contracts, it issues csTokens that are fully backed, fully fungible value-accrual tokens. These tokens increase in value as they start receiving the staking rewards from the network.

Users can also utilize these tokens as base capital to participate in other DeFi protocols. The combined yield from staking rewards and participating in DeFi compounds over time increasing the net profit for the user.

ClayStack is accessible at https://app.claystack.com

### csToken

csTokens are standard ERC20 tokens that represents the claim to both the underlying Token and the staking rewards, thus csTokens continuously appreciate in value with respect to the base Token, abstracting away for the complexity of staking, claiming, and re-staking.

Users can opt to sell their csTokens instead of unstaking, in that way avoiding unstaking fees or waiting for "unbonding" period unstil their tokens are available for withdrawal.

### Staking

The process of staking involves the transfer of the underlying token to ClayStack's smart contract, which in turn will mint csTokens at the current exchange rate and will thereafter stake the underlying tokens on trusted validators. Most protocols will employ a delegate staking system, thus ensuring the safety of the funds for the users.

### Standard Unstaking

ClayStack's contract offers a direct unstaking mechanism, which leverages the PoS chain unstaking system. In most cases, users will need to wait a period of time before their tokens are made available. Depending on the protocol, this "unbonding" period can range from a few days to 1 year.

### Flash Exit

ClayStack's contract offers a unique feature acting as a liquidity pool, where users can unstake and immediately receive the underlying Token. The feature removes the need for any waiting time, yet there may be fees and limits on amounts.
