ClayStack is a decentralized, trustless and non-custodial cross-chain liquid staking protocol. Through the ClayStack protocol, staked assets with deep liquidity can exist on multiple chains. The protocol accomplishes this by releasing tokenized claims in smart contracts on staked assets from core PoS protocols, a.k.a staking derivatives.

ClayStack's protocol uses a main contract, ClayMain, for users to transfer supported ERC20 tokens, and in return get a secondary ERC20 token "csToken". The contract will in turn stake/unstake into validating nodes. The csToken will appreciate in value vs the underlying token as rewards from the validators are recognized.
