# Security & Governance

At ClayStack, we take security very seriously. We invest in both creating secure protocols and secure processes for the safety of funds and the reliability of the protocol.

### Governance

ClayStack is currently governed by the ClayStack Foundation. ClayStack is planning to transition to a DAO, where the DAO's main responsibilities would be:
- Custody of assets
- Adjustments to fees
- Grants proposals and approvals
- Community rewards
- Cross-chain ecosystem

### Operations TimeLock
